{"name":"Scidev","tagline":"Code for Science, Code for Humanity","body":"### SciDev Conference\r\nThere is a growing problem in academic science that is only being address incrementally by funding agencies. Science is becoming completely dependent on code, but scientists have roundly rejected adding code to their core curriculum. This gap between scientist and developer can be linked to retracted papers, a massive brain drain, and software isolation in the conclaves of the ivory tower.\r\n\r\nOutside of academia, the need for scientific software is growing rapidly. Massive data analytics engines use methods and techniques pioneered by scientific computing. The growing buzz over simple advances to basic statistics shows the production software grasping for better theory often locked away in unusable academic scientific software.\r\n\r\nAlas, there is not a single place that software engineers and scientists can go to share ideas in a raw state. Developer conferences are crowded with people who cower at mathematics. Scientific conferences abhor code. And places where code and math can live on the same screen, such as SciPyConf or user workshops, are burdened by adhering to a narrow focus. The growing popularity of industry-driven conferences -- which are enjoying an increasing attendance by academic professionals -- demonstrates the desire for a more broadly focused, scientific development conference.\r\n\r\nWe propose a fresh take on conferences for those poor creatures with a love of science and development. Neither science conference nor developer conference alone, but a hybrid that allows for an embrace of the code driving the innovation in science. Interdisciplinary studies have promoted the cross-pollination of ideas between disciplines; we propose expanding this beyond the theoretical, and into the implementation.\r\n\r\n","google":"UA-388278-11","note":"Don't delete this file!
